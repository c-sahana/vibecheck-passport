## ✨ Project Title

✈️ VibeCheck Passport: Where AI guesses, but you decide.

---

## 🌟 Inspiration

I wanted to build something only I could make — part travel game, part emotional diary, part critique of AI. AI keeps saying it “understands me.” But does it really?

I turned that question into a passport for feelings.
AI can name your moods — but you control the map. Because no algorithm should own your vibe.

## 🎭 What It Does

🌍 You type in your mood.
🤖 AI invents a fictional country for that feeling (“Procrastistan 🐢”, “Naplandia 💤”).
🛂 At “customs,” Customs officers(AI) asks you one weird question.
🎒 Your answer becomes baggage (with a quirky emoji badge) to claim.
📖 Your passport fills up with countries, baggage, and badges — a scrapbook of your emotional journey.

And here’s the twist:
✏️ You can rename AI’s countries. Because sometimes, only you know what your feeling should be called. **Right?**

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- Backend: Express.js server + OpenRouter API for GPT-3.5-turbo
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (lots of hand-crafted animations & vibes)
- Storage: LocalStorage for your “emotional passport”
- Design: Scrapbook-inspired — floating stamps, random tilts, doodle energy

## ⚔️ Challenges I Ran Into

AI sometimes mislabels moods (hello, “Mehghanistan” 🙃). But that became part of the magic — showing AI’s limits, and giving humans the final word.

Designing it to feel fun, not sterile — every pixel had to feel like a “human-first” world, not just an AI tool.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments I am Proud Of

✅ Created a fully working app that’s playful, weird, and deeply personal.
✅ Blended AI whimsy + human override — you can literally rewrite AI’s “decisions.”
✅ Turned mood tracking into something delightfully chaotic — not just another boring chatbot.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- AI is great at wordplay… but terrible at nuance.
- Humans don’t just “use” AI — we edit, remix, and reclaim it.
- Hackathon code can still have soul (and emojis. lots of emojis).
